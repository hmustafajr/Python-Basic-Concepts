>>> "Python is pretty darn easy"
'Python is pretty darn easy'
>>> 'Look on the bright side'
'Look on the bright side'

// One issue is that if you want to add quotes to a string you have to do this
>>> 'Hassan\'s dog is super floofy'
'Hassan's dog is super floofy

// \n returns a new line
// or you could just use a hard return (enter key)
>>> "Hey friend
this is pretty rad"
' Hey friend
this is pretty rad'
