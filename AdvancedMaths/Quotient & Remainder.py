# To determine the quotient and remainder of a division you will use the floor division and modulo operators, respectively

# Floor division is done using double forward slashes, which explains why comments are done differently
>>> 20 // 6
3

# Modulo operator is carried out with the '%' symbol
>>> 1.25 % 0.5
0.25

# These operators can be used with both floats and integers

# One noticed was that
>>> 20 % 6
# returns
2
# because 3 * 6 + 2 = 20
